# Python Sandbox

This repo contains the first proyect that I build using Python. 
All the structure was created following the instructions here: [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/es/).

The idea behind this was to create a simple blog, in which you could perform basic CRUD operations. 

Later, it has used as a base to test the [Typeform API](https://developer.typeform.com/get-started/) and its Responses API.

The data from responses it's also saved here: [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GO1Gkc1tfAgw0ti-007_cx4K6nN6siUXErskbDCkqnY/edit#gid=249915197)

The production build for this is hosted in:
violetalibertad.pythonanywhere.com

To run this project: 
1. Clone the repo
2. In a terminal, run this code: `pipenv install`
3. Activate the virtual env with this: `pipenv shell`
4. Run the server with: `python manage.py runserver`
5. To exit the virtual env just write `exit`

* NOTE: Steps 3 to 5 can be replaced with this command: `pipenv run python manage.py runserver`. This can be exited with `CTRL + C`
